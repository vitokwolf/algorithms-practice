### _Arithmetic_

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of each function defined to accomplish the following:

  - **add**: returns the result of `num1` plus `num2`.

  - **subtract**: returns the result of `num1` minus `num2`.

  - **multiply**: returns the result of `num1` times `num2`.

  - **divide**: returns the result of `num1` divided by `num2`.

  - Print all numbers from the given `num` argument to `1` inclusive.

    - e.g. given the number `10` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      10
      9
      8
      7
      6
      5
      4

### *Sum Array*

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following:

  - Add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

    - e.g. given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 1, 5, 6]
    ```

    - The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    15
    ```

- [Vowel Count](#vowel-count)

---

### _FizzBuzz_

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `fizzBuzz` function to achieve the following:

  - Iterate through each number in the given array.

  - If a number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz" to the console.

  - If a number is evenly divisible by 5 print "Buzz" to the console.

  - If a number is evenly divisible by 3 and 5, print "Fizz Buzz" to the console.

  - Else print the number.

    - e.g. given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    ```

    - The following should be printed to the console:

### *Factorial*

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `factorial` function to achieve the following:

  - Return the factorial of the given `num` integer.

  - A factorial of a number is the product of all of all positive integers less than or equal to the number.

  - e.g. given the following number:

  ```js
  var num = 3
  ```

  - The following number should be returned:

  ```js
  6
  // 1 x 2 x 3 === 6
  ```

  - If given `0`, the factorial should be `1`. Otherwise assume the given number will be a whole positive number.

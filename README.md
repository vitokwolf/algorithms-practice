# Algorithms Practice

## Arithmetic

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of each function defined to accomplish the following:

  - **add**: returns the result of `num1` plus `num2`.

  - **subtract**: returns the result of `num1` minus `num2`.

  - **multiply**: returns the result of `num1` times `num2`.

  - **divide**: returns the result of `num1` divided by `num2`.

## Odd or Even

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `oddOrEven` function to achieve the following:

  - If `num` is evenly divisible by 2, return the string "even".

  - If `num` is NOT evenly divisible by 2, return the string "odd".

## Log Nums

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `logNums` function to achieve the following:

  - Print all numbers from `1` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive.

    - e.g. given the number `5` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      1
      2
      3
      4
      5
      ```

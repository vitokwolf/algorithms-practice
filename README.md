# Algorithms Practice

## Arithmetic

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of each function defined to accomplish the following:

  - **add**: returns the result of `num1` plus `num2`.

  - **subtract**: returns the result of `num1` minus `num2`.

  - **multiply**: returns the result of `num1` times `num2`.

  - **divide**: returns the result of `num1` divided by `num2`.

## Odd or Even

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `oddOrEven` function to achieve the following:

  - If `num` is evenly divisible by 2, return the string "even".

  - If `num` is NOT evenly divisible by 2, return the string "odd".

## Log Nums

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `logNums` function to achieve the following:

  - Print all numbers from `1` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive.

    - e.g. given the number `5` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      1
      2
      3
      4
      5
      ```

## Log Even Nums

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `logEvenNums` function to achieve the following:

  - Print all even numbers from `0` up to the given `nums` argument inclusive.

    - e.g. given the number `6` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      0
      2
      4
      6
      ```

## Countdown

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `countdown` function to achieve the following:

  - Print all numbers from the given `num` argument to `1` inclusive.

    - e.g. given the number `10` as the `num` argument, the following should be printed to the console, one log at a time:

      ```bash
      10
      9
      8
      7
      6
      5
      4
      3
      2
      1
      ```

## Sum Array

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `sumArray` function to achieve the following:

  - Add all of the numbers in the given `arr` array argument and return the total.

    - e.g. given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 1, 5, 6]
    ```

    - The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    15
    ```

## FizzBuzz

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `fizzBuzz` function to achieve the following:

  - Iterate through each number in the given array.

  - If a number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Fizz" to the console.

  - If a number is evenly divisible by 5 print "Buzz" to the console.

  - If a number is evenly divisible by 3 and 5, print "Fizz Buzz" to the console.

  - Else print the number.

    - e.g. given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    ```

    - The following should be printed to the console:

    ```js
    13
    14
    ;('Fizz Buzz')
    ;('Fizz')
    17
    ;('Fizz')
    19
    ;('Buzz')
    ```

## Max Num

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `maxNum` function to achieve the following:

  - Return the largest number present in the given `arr` array.

    - e.g. given the following array:

    ```js
    var arr = [3, 1, 17, 5, 6]
    ```

    - The following number should be returned:

    ```js
    17
    ```

## Vowel Count

- In this file you will be writing code in the body of the `vowelCount` function to achieve the following:

  - Return the number of vowels present in `str`.
